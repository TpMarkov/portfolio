❗Areas You Should Improve

Here’s how web developer portfolios are typically evaluated and where your site can do better:

1. Domain & Trust Signals

Your domain webdevstudiohq.online doesn’t yet have any public trust score/reviews in tools (common issue for new niche sites). Older, established domains often perform better.
Consider using a .com/.dev domain and buying WHOIS info that shows your identity if you intend to build trust.

2. Real Testimonials / Social Proof

Right now there are no client reviews or testimonials. Adding even a few real client quotes greatly boosts credibility.

3. Case Studies Instead of Just Projects

Listing projects is good, but case studies (problem → solution → outcome → metrics) tell visitors how you solved real problems.
For example: “Increased load speed by 55% for X business.”

4. Clear Value Proposition

Your homepage needs a clearer single line like:

“I help businesses grow online with fast, secure, and SEO-optimized websites.”

Right now it’s descriptive, but not targeted for conversion.

5. Performance & Responsiveness

Make sure the site:

Loads fast on mobile and desktop

Looks professional on all screen sizes
Mobile friendliness is a must for professional portfolios.

6. Contact & Lead Capture

Include:

A clear contact form

Optional scheduling widget (Calendly)

Email address and phone number

Right now a “Contact” label is there but ensure it’s functional and visible upfront.❗Areas You Should Improve
